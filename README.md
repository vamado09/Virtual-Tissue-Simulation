# Virtual-Tissue-Simulation
Virtual Tissue Simulation Web Application

This repository showcases the development journey of a custom web application designed for Virtual Tissue Simulation (VTS), originally conceptualized to enhance user interaction with simulation packages through a dynamic web interface. The initial development phase involved creating a Streamlit web application intended to serve as an interactive platform for displaying markdown files populated directly from GitHub.

## Development Highlights:
Markdown File Integration: Utilized markdown files, dynamically generated by a custom Python script, the Knowledge Object Generator, created by Daniel Perez and Martin Breth, fellow team members from the VTS group at Indiana University Bloomington.

Streamlit to Hugo Transition: Initially built with Streamlit to enable real-time web interactions, the project transitioned to using Hugo templates to establish a more robust and scalable solution for creating static websites that effectively display simulation data and research findings.

Advanced Features: The original Streamlit application integrated cutting-edge functionalities, including an OpenAI-powered chatbot for interactive user engagement and a text summarizer tailored for condensing scientific papers, facilitating a more efficient dissemination of complex research insights.

## Project Evolution:
This repository not only reflects the technological pivots made during the project but also embodies our commitment to adapting and employing the best tools available to communicate and visualize scientific data effectively. By moving from Streamlit to Hugo, we enhanced the site's stability and user experience, making the research accessible to a broader audience without sacrificing the interactive elements that define modern web applications.

## Current Implementation:
The current version of the website uses Hugo templates to manage and display content efficiently, with a design that prioritizes ease of navigation and user engagement. This approach has significantly streamlined the presentation of data, allowing users to access a wealth of information through a well-organized and visually appealing interface.

This repository serves as both a historical archive of our developmental process and a current snapshot of our ongoing efforts to promote Virtual Tissue Simulation through innovative web technology.
