## What Is Artistoo Simulation Package

Artistoo (Artificial Tissue Toolbox) is a framework that lets you build interactive, explorable simulation models of cells and tissues in the web browsers. In few words, it is a software tool used for simulating biological tissue. This package is particularly useful in computational biology and bioinformatics, where understanding cell behaviors in a virtual environment is essential.

The platform is available under the MIT open-source license and was created by Inge M.N.Wortel and Johannes Textor. It implements the Cellular Potts Model (CPM), a versatile framework for simulating various biological processes at the tissue scale. Additionally, it can also handle simpler Cellular Automaton (CA) models. Simulations can be shared via URLs or HTML files without requiring software installation. It features an interactive interface, allowing users to modify parameters in real-time through HTML sliders and input fields.

## Who Should Use Artistoo Simulation Package

Artistoo is a versatile simulation package that allows users to build highly customizable simulations of cells and tissues in the web browser. It is particularly useful for individuals in computational biology and bioinformatics who need to understand cell behaviors in a virtual environment.

## Alternative Options of Artistoo Simulation Package

While Artistoo is a powerful simulation package for building customizable simulations, there are alternative options available for users who require additional features or compatibility with other frameworks. 

One alternative option is the Morpheus framework, which offers a wide range of methods that may not be supported by Artistoo. Morpheus provides solvers for reaction-diffusion equations, SBML-encoded intracellular signaling, and output formats like VTK and HDF5. 

Additionally, frameworks such as CHASTE, CompuCell3D, and Tissue Simulation Toolkit also offer unique features that may not be available in Artistoo. These frameworks cater to specific modeling needs and may be more suitable for certain types of simulations.

To facilitate the transition between different frameworks, a prototype tool has been developed to help users convert models between Artistoo and Morpheus. This tool aims to make it easier for users to leverage the strengths of each framework and create more comprehensive simulations.

While Artistoo may not support all features of existing frameworks, its highly customizable nature and modular structure make it a valuable tool for building CPM models. Users can still construct a wide range of simulations using Artistoo and benefit from its interactive and shareable capabilities.

In conclusion, users should explore alternative options based on their specific modeling requirements and consider the unique features offered by different frameworks to enhance their simulation experience.

## Example Deployments

Artistoo allows users to build highly customizable simulations, and its highly modular structure makes it easy for future users to extend the framework with custom code. Its performance is comparable to that of existing frameworks. We do not envision Artistoo to replace existing modelling software; rather, it can complement existing software directed at computational biologists and developers by letting users build explorable and sharable versions of a simulation. Indeed, to the best of our knowledge, Artistoo is the first simulation framework supporting interactive simulations in the web browser that can be shared via a simple URL. We hope that this will unlock the use of (CPM) simulations to a much larger audience.

We do not envision Artistoo to replace existing modelling software; rather, it can complement software directed at computational biologists and developers by letting users build explorable and sharable versions of a simulation. To facilitate this process, we have built a prototype tool to help users convert models between different frameworks (currently: Artistoo and Morpheus). Although Artistoo already offers a wide range of methods, it does not yet support all features of existing frameworks (Morpheus, CHASTE, CompuCell3D, Tissue Simulation Toolkit), such as solvers for reaction-diffusion equations or SBML-encoded intracellular signalling, or writing output in formats like VTK and HDF5. Nevertheless, Artistoo simulations are highly customizable, and a wide range of CPM models can already be constructed using the framework in its current state. The software's modular structure also makes it easy for future developers to extend it with custom code.

Artistoo has many potential applications and is a valuable education, learning, and collaboration tool. It may also encourage more open science, as having more accessible computational models could help with peer review and make it easier to collaborate across different research fields. A similar approach could be used to provide access to many other types of models in biology and beyond.

Users do not need to install any software: Artistoo models run on any platform providing a standards-compliant web browser – be it a desktop computer, a tablet, or a mobile phone. These simulations can be published on any web server or saved locally and do not rely on any back-end servers being available. They can be made explorable, enabling viewers to interact with the simulation and see the effect of changing model parameters in real time.
