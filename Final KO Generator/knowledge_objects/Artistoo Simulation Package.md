## Alternative Options of Artistoo Simulation Package

While Artistoo offers a wide range of methods and allows users to build highly customizable simulations, there are alternative options available for those looking to explore different features or functionalities. 

One such option is the Morpheus framework, which provides additional features not currently supported by Artistoo. These include solvers for reaction-diffusion equations, SBML-encoded intracellular signaling, and the ability to write output in formats like VTK and HDF5. 

For users who require these specific features, Morpheus may be a more suitable choice. However, it is important to note that Artistoo simulations are highly customizable, and a wide range of Cellular Potts Model (CPM) models can already be constructed using the framework in its current state. 

Additionally, to facilitate the conversion of models between different frameworks, a prototype tool has been developed to assist users in transitioning between Artistoo and Morpheus. This tool aims to make it easier for users to explore different simulation options and leverage the strengths of each framework. 

Ultimately, the choice between Artistoo and alternative options will depend on the specific needs and requirements of the user. Both frameworks offer valuable tools for computational biologists and developers, and the modular structure of Artistoo makes it easy for future developers to extend the framework with custom code.

## Example Deployments

Artistoo allows users to build highly customizable simulations, and its highly modular structure makes it easy for future users to extend the framework with custom code. Its performance is comparable to that of existing frameworks. We do not envision Artistoo to replace existing modelling software; rather, it can complement existing software directed at computational biologists and developers by letting users build explorable and sharable versions of a simulation. Indeed, to the best of our knowledge, Artistoo is the first simulation framework supporting interactive simulations in the web browser that can be shared via a simple URL. We hope that this will unlock the use of (CPM) simulations to a much larger audience.

We do not envision Artistoo to replace existing modelling software; rather, it can complement software directed at computational biologists and developers by letting users build explorable and sharable versions of a simulation. To facilitate this process, we have built a prototype tool to help users convert models between different frameworks (currently: Artistoo and Morpheus). Although Artistoo already offers a wide range of methods, it does not yet support all features of existing frameworks (Morpheus, CHASTE, CompuCell3D, Tissue Simulation Toolkit), such as solvers for reaction-diffusion equations or SBML-encoded intracellular signaling, or writing output in formats like VTK and HDF5. Nevertheless, Artistoo simulations are highly customizable, and a wide range of CPM models can already be constructed using the framework in its current state. The software's modular structure also makes it easy for future developers to extend it with custom code.

Artistoo has many potential applications and is a valuable education, learning, and collaboration tool. It may also encourage more open science, as having more accessible computational models could help with peer review and make it easier to collaborate across different research fields. A similar approach could be used to provide access to many other types of models in biology and beyond.

Users do not need to install any software: Artistoo models run on any platform providing a standards-compliant web browser – be it a desktop computer, a tablet, or a mobile phone. These simulations can be published on any web server or saved locally and do not rely on any back-end servers being available. They can be made explorable, enabling viewers to interact with the simulation and see the effect of changing model parameters in real time.
