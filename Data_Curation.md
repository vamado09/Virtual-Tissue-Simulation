1.  What is Machine Learning and Deep Learning?

-   Machine Learning: A branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that
    develops algorithms to make predictions on new, similar types of
    data by learning hidden patterns from datasets.

-   Example: Teaching a computer to distinguish between apples and
    oranges using pictures and labels.

-   Deep Learning: A subset of machine learning based on artificial
    neural networks, mimicking the human brain.

-   Example: Teaching a computer to recognize different varieties of
    apples and oranges, and their ripeness, using layers in a neural
    network.

2.  Data Curation in Machine Learning and Deep Learning:

-   Curation means "to take care". Like a librarian\'s role, data
    curation involves collecting, annotating, preprocessing, enhancing,
    and organizing data for machine learning.

-   **Importance**: Ensures data used for machine learning and deep
    learning is accurate, consistent, and high-quality, leading to more
    effective models.

3.  Historical Perspective of Data Curation:

    small, clean datasets. Example: Iris flower dataset.

-   **Rise of Large-Scale Datasets (1990s)**: Increased computing power
    led to larger datasets. Example: UCI Machine Learning Repository,
    MNIST dataset.

-   **The 2000s -- 2010s**: Emergence of automated tools for data
    collection, cleaning, and labeling.

4.  Data Curation Process:

-   Data collection: Gathering data from various sources.

-   Data cleaning: Eliminating duplicates, handling outliers, etc.

-   Data annotation: Labeling data for supervised learning.
